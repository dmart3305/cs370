Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  The code I created was the deep q learning algorithm that was implemented between the "#start here" pseudo code and the "#This is a small utility for printing readable time strings:" pseudocode. 
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  computer scientists experiment, design, and develop software to help solve real-world problems or try to make real-world problems easier. This matters because it attempts to make peoples lives easier through the use of technology. It also can push human knowledge further espeicially with the advancements within artificial inteligence.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  when approaching a problem as a computer scientist you should anaylize the problem you are given and the enviroment you are in, break the problem into smaller pieces, use pseudocode to explain code blocks, and use constant testing.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities to end users is to be transparent about the data we are using while ensuring the data is safely secured. My ethical responsibilities to the organization is being responsible with the reasources I am given, following their guidelines, and acting in the companies best interest.
